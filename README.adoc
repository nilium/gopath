NAME
----
gopath - print a GOPATH


SYNOPSIS
--------
*gopath* ['OPTIONS'] ['PATH']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
gopath writes to standard output a new GOPATH based on the current GOPATH and
any .go-path entries found in directories listed either on the command line or,
if nothing is listed on the command line, the current directory.

A .go-path file may be empty, in which case it is treated as a marker for the
directory it is in. Otherwise, each line in the .go-path file is used as a new
entry in the GOPATH, in order from top to bottom.

gopath can also search for files other than .go-path using the *-marker*
option (e.g., .goproj, .goenv, etc.). Only one marker name can be used per run
of gopath, but it's always possible to concatenate the results of two gopath
runs.

By default, gopath will search all directories up to the root ('/'). To disable
this and make gopath stop at the first marker/wgo workspace (or both) found,
you can pass `-to-root=false`.


WGO SUPPORT
-----------
If a workspace, project, etc. contains a W/.gocfg/gopaths file, gopath will
incorporate that into the resulting GOPATH variable. This works more or less
the same as .go-path, except the resulting GOPATH entries are relative to W
instead of the directory containing the file itself.


TODO
----
- Support recursive lookup of .go-path entries? Possibly useful for projects
  with nested dependent gopaths, but at that point it seems more like you're
  working with a defective project structure.
- Support multiple .go-path marker names. This is semi-useful because I
  previously used .go-root files to mark GOPATH entries. Still, that's trivial
  to fix by renaming files.


OPTIONS
-------
*-marker*='".go-path"'::
	The name of the marker indicating a GOPATH entry to search for.

*-to-root*='true'::
	Whether to continue searching up through parent directories even after
	a marker has been found.
